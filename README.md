Hi! My name is Joann L. Monteverde,
I'm from Zamboanga City.
I just recently resigned from my full time job to pusue a career in tech.

I'm currently fond of doing crochet.
I do read books sometimes.
And I love watching feel good movies.

My goal for the 2023 is to land a tech job.

I want to be a web developer because I want to make something I would be proud of. I also like knowing how things work and being a web developer is something like that.
